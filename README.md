# IMG-SHR

A basic Imgur clone built for the purpose of learning Go, HTMX, and Go templates

## Functionality

* File uploads

* Posts can be given a title

* Home page to view the latest N posts

* Basic upload input validation (file type, max file size, etc.)

## Missing Functionality

* User accounts / logins

  * I originally planned to require a user to be logged in before they could upload, and posts would be associated with the user, but I got what I needed out of this project so I likely won't bother

* Upvote/downvote posts

  * Another idea I originally planned to include with this, but won't bother with since I learned what I needed to from this project
